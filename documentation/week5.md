## What did I do?

-   I peer reviewed one of my peers.
-   I changed the data structure of the board from an array of arrays to a single long array.
    -   2x performance gain
-   I cleaned the code of the minimax algorithm.
-   I implemented alpha-beta pruning
    -   35x performance gain!

## Questions

The 35x performance gain of implementing alpha-beta pruning was a surprise. I had previously seen some article that featured a formula for the performance gain of alpha-beta pruning. Using that formula I got a result that in the best case scenario I should get a 10x gain. Now I'm wondering why did I get a performance so much higher?

## What next?

-   Optimize the minimax algorithm and the program in general with many tricks I have thought of.
-   Implement an algorithm for choosing the starting position.
    -   Right now the program assumes that you provide it with a board with the starting stacks in place.
-   Write testing and implementation reports.
-   Implement the player vs AI mode.
