## What did I do?

-   I optimized the minimax algorithm in multiple ways, mainly related to move ordering.
    -   13x performance gain
-   I moved tests into a separate file.
-   I increased the minimax search depth from 4 to 6 turns.

## What next?

-   Optimize the the program with more tricks.
    -   Transposition table
    -   Move ordering using values from the last turn (iterative deepening)
    -   Parallelization
-   Implement an algorithm for choosing the starting position.
    -   Right now the program assumes that you provide it with a board with the starting stacks in place.
-   Improve implementation report.
-   Implement the player vs AI mode.
