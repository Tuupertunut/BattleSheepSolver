## What did I do?

-   I implemented the minimax algorithm.
-   I implemented a better UI with colors and it almost looks hexagonal.
-   I added tests for the heuristic evaluation function.
    -   It was quite interesting to come up with different edge cases where the heuristic might fail terribly.
-   I added more utility functions for Board and refactored the code.
-   I wrote usage instructions.

## Questions

Currently none.

## What next?

-   Optimize the minimax algorithm and the program in general with many tricks I have thought of.
-   Implement an algorithm for choosing the starting position.
    -   Right now the program assumes that you provide it with a board with the starting stacks in place.
-   Write testing and implementation reports.
